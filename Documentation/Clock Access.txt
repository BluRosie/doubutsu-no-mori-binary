  The Real-Time Clock (RTC) is accessed via PIF on channel 5 (counting 1-6).
  It uses three PIF commands not normally used in games: 6, 7, 8.

  The clock itself consists of 0x18 bytes, accessed in 0x8 clusters.  Block 0 acts as a device controller, and the time can be found on block 2.  Currently, the use of the second block is unknown.  All three blocks have read/write access.
  It is interesting to note that the time kept on the clock is in decimal, not hexadecimal.  The year is read as a offset from 1900.

  In order to write the the RTC, you must first untoggle the read-only bitflags in the control register for the appropriate block#, and you will also want to disable the clock temporarily.  When finished, be certain to set them back to their original settings and reactivate the timer.

Clock Data
block 0:	control registers
	0x0	1	control register hi
		01	block 1 read-only when set
		02	block 2 read-only when set
	0x1	1	control register lo
		02	set when timer running
		04	deactivate timer

block 1:
	unknown.  No known access within Animal Forest

block 2:	time registers: all time stored as decimal values!
	0x0	1	seconds
	0x1	1	minutes
	0x2	1	hours
	0x3	1	day of week
	0x4	1	day of month
	0x5	1	month
	0x6	2	year since 1900 (intel byteswapping like all PIF data)

PIF command 6: RTC status	01.03:06;dddd.ss
Superficially identical to a normal PIFcmd0 status request.
0x0	1	write: 1
0x1	1	read: 3
0x2	1	command: 6
0x3	2	device type.  RTC should return 1000 (assumming 16k eeprom returns 4000)
0x5	1	status flags
	01	unknown; fails access
	02	unknown; fails access
	80	busy

PIF command 7: read RTC block	02.09:07.bb;dddddddddddddddd.ss
0x0	1	write: 2
0x1	1	read: 9
0x2	1	command: 7
0x3	1	block # (0-2)
0x4	8	data
0xC	1	status

PIF command 8: write RTC block	0A.01:08.bb.dddddddddddddddd;ss
0x0	1	write: 10
0x1	1	read: 1
0x2	1	command: 8
0x3	1	block # (0-2)
0x4	8	data
0xC	1	status
