    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>beat is a delta-based binary differencing patcher and specification. It
    encodes the differences between either a) two files, or b) two folders, and
    stores the difference as a beat patch.</p>

    <p>Unlike linear patches, delta patches can detect and encode data
    insertions and deletions. What this means is that patches against files that
    have had data inserted or removed from them are <i>substantially</i>
    smaller.</p>

    <p>Patches that encode the difference between two files use the .bps
    extension, short for "beat patch - single (file)"</p>

    <p>Patches that encode the difference between two folders full of files use
    the .bpm extension, sort for "beat patch - multi (file)"</p>

    <h3>Applying patches</h3>
    <p>Run beat, and click the "Apply Patch" button.</p>

    <p>First, you will be asked to choose a beat patch file.</p>

    <h4>If you select a bps patch ...</h4>

    <p>You will be asked to select the original, unmodified file first.</p>

    <p>Finally, you will be asked to select where to save the patched file to.
    This is the output file. You cannot choose the same file to apply the patch
    to. This is because if patch application were to fail, it might damage the
    original file. This also lets the original file serve as an unpatched
    backup. This is important as beat patches are a one-way transformation, and
    cannot be undone.</p>

    <p>The output file should be a new file that does not yet exist, so type a
    new name into the file name box and hit save.</p>

    <h4>If you select a bpm patch ...</h4>

    <p>You will be asked to select the original, unmodified folder first.</p>

    <p>Finally, you will be asked to select where to save the patched directory
    to. This is the output folder. This works similarly to file patching, in
    that you must select a new folder name: you cannot apply a patch directly to
    a folder.</p>

    <p>You should create a new folder using the beat folder selection dialog
    here. The output folder will be lost if patch application fails.</p>

    <h4>Patching process</h4>

    <p>Patch application will now begin. The beat user interface will be
    unresponsive during this time. Please be patient and wait until beat
    displays a message: this will indicate whether patch application was
    successful or not.</p>

    <p>Pretty much the only reason patch application will fail is if you choose
    the wrong source file. beat patches embed checksums to make sure that you
    apply it to the same source file that the patch was created against. Make
    sure you are using the correct file, and try again.</p>

    <h3>Creating patches</h3>
    <p>Run beat. You have two options along the bottom of the user interface to
    control how the patch is created.</p>

    <h4>Embed manifest</h4>
    <p>beat patches can embed an XML manifest file that describes what this
    patch is for. The XML manifest must be XML version 1.0 with UTF-8 encoding,
    but otherwise the document contents are domain-specific. In other words, you
    are free to put whatever you want here. Typically, you might want to embed
    authorship information, copyright information, a link to your website, etc.
    But it's entirely up to you.</p>

    <p>This is completely optional. If you check this, you will be asked at the
    end of the patch creation to select a manifest file to embed. If you do not,
    this part will be skipped and the beat patch will have no manifest. The beat
    patch will still work to patch files exactly as you would expect.</p>

    <h4>Delta mode</h4>
    <p>Linear patches can be performed in linear time, or O(n). Whereas delta
    patches require quadratic time, or O(n^2). Optimizations exist to
    significantly reduce the delta patch overhead, of course. But only so much
    can be done. The more a delta patch is optimized, the less effective it is
    at spotting insertions and deletions.</p>

    <p>In laymen's terms: delta patches take a lot longer to create. The bigger
    the file, the longer it takes compared to a linear patch. This could
    potentially be hours for a file that is hundreds of megabytes in size.</p>

    <p>But in return, delta patches are often substantially smaller than linear
    patches.</p>

    <p>If you are certain that your changes only modify data (and do not insert
    or delete data), or you need the patch to be created quicker, you can leave
    this unchecked. But if you want the smallest patch size possible, and don't
    mind being patient, you'll want to check this option.</p>

    <h4>Mode selection</h4>
    <p>You are now ready to create your patch. Choose either "Create File Patch"
    or "Create Folder Patch", depending on what you want to do.</p>

    <p>If you are only modifying a single file, a file (bps) patch is strongly
    recommended. But if you are modifying more than one file, you will need to
    create a folder (bpm) patch instead.</p>

    <h4>If you select a file patch ...</h4>
    <p>First, you will be asked to select the original, unmodified file.</p>

    <p>Next, you will be asked to select the modified file.</p>

    <p>Next, you will be asked where to save the patch that is about to be
    created. You will make up your own name for the patch file here, as the
    patch obviously does not exist yet.</p>

    <p>Finally, if you chose to embed a manifest, you will be asked to select
    a manifest XML file here.</p>

    <p>The main window will now be unresponsive until patch creation is
    completed. If you chose to create a delta patch, this can take several
    minutes or even hours, depending on how big the files are. Please be patient
    and wait for a message indicating success.</p>

    <h4>If you select a folder patch ...</h4>
    <p>The same steps as selecting a file patch apply here. Just note that you
    are first asked to select a source folder, and then a target folder.</p>

    <h3>Command-line usage</h3>
    <p>beat can also be used on the command-line.</p>

    <p>When no arguments are given, the user interface is opened.</p>

    <h4>To apply a patch from the command-line ...</h4>
    <pre>beat -apply -p patch -o output input</pre>

    <h4>To create a patch from the command-line ...</h4>
    <pre>beat -create [-delta] [-m manifest] -p patch -o output input</pre>

    <h4>beat patch association</h4>
    <p>You may associate beat with .bps and/or .bpm files. When this is done,
    the user interface will be activated, and the "Apply Patch" process will
    begin. However, the patch name will already have been selected, so that part
    will be skipped. This can be used as a faster way to apply patches.</p>
