  There are still certain limitations on the length of some text entries.  This is due either to buffer size, or because it would need to fry parts of save data.
  Until workarounds can be made for them all, here are the current maximum string lengths for entries in text banks that sort of thing applies to.

Maximum entry sizes for certain text banks:
message_txt	0x400	total size, including inserted strings (ie. player's name)
	workaround: copy half of the text to another entry.  Place a [jump] command in the original text entry and link it to the new one.  
mail_txt	0x68
maila_txt	0x68
mailb_txt	0x68
mailc_txt	0x68
psz_txt	0x12
superz_txt	0x14
npc_names	0x8

select_txt	0x2C for select menu entries.  This ensures they aren't clipped if you pull them after selection.  Those not appearing on a select menu can probably be any size.

  For the record, other routines do limit the size of entries from time to time in specific cases.  In particular, some of the 7F commands.
  As I go back through the notes and find them all they'll get entered in here.

  The hacked text banks do have a limit on the number of entries, although this can be raised and lowered.  As per the current patch, these are the most possible entries within each text bank.

Maximum number of entries in the hacked text banks:
block name	#tbl	size of text block
message_txt	0x3F94	0x290000
select_txt	0x25F	0x1900
mail_txt	0x3D6	0x1F000
super_txt	0x3D6	0x2900
ps_txt	0x3D6	0x3800
string_txt	0x7FF	0x4300
maila_txt	0x184	0x5000
mailb_txt	0x184	0x7000
mailc_txt	0x184	0x3000
psz_txt	0x184	0x1000
superz_txt	0x184	0x1000
npc_names	0xEE	0x770
