How to Apply the Animal Forest .bps Patch
-----------------------------------------

  Applying a .bps patch is just as simple as a .ips patch, and Byuu's patch tool is provided in this distribution.  There's a few extra steps to make an uneditted Japanese Doubutsu no Mori game ready for patching, but those are simple enough too.
  If you use the .bps patch you will +NOT+ need to extend the ROM!

  You'll need two files from this big zip of stuff:
  In the 'Programs' folder: bps/beat.exe
  In the main directory: WIP_day_month_year.bps
	(The day, month, and year differ on the release date of the patch)

  You can also get the patcher source and specification from it's creator here:
  http://byuu.org/programming/beat/

  There is also a python version available at:

Applying the Patch
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  Byuu's bps patching program is provided in the 'programs' folder.  Find the folder named 'bps'; the program 'beat.exe' is what you'll use to apply the patch.
  Step-by-Step
  1) Run 'beat.exe'
  2) Press the 'apply patch' button.
  3) Select the filename for the 'WIP_day_month_year.bps' file and press 'open'.
  5) Select the filename for the original ROM and press 'open'.  You can only use an unmodified, unbyteswapped ROM with this patch.
  6) Type in a filename for the patched file.  Be sure to add an extension such as .n64 as this is not done automatically.  Press save to start the patch process.

  If you recieve a checksum error, one of these is true:
  * The ROM is byteswapped.  You'll need to use a byteswapping program to fix this.
  * The ROM is the wrong size.  It should be 16MB (128Mb) in size.
  * The ROM has been editted in some fashion.  Only use an original ROM.

  If your ROM is extended and unbyteswapped you can use the xdelta patch instead.
