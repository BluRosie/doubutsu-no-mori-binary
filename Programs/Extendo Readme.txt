  Extendo is a small and ugly little program that makes a copy of an N64 rom, unbyteswapped, and offering to extend it to double its size.  Crazy enough, it is really generic because for some peculiar reason this keeps popping up.  It does not test the checksum.  There's plenty of better tools to do that at Dextrose.

  When you drop an N64 rom onto the program it creates one of the same name, but tacks in place of its extension -ext.n64.  It will not alter your original ROM in any way.
  16 and 32bit byteswapping are automatically detected, and if found you'll be prompted to switch to unbyteswapped mode.  Usually that's what you want if you're applying patches.  Half the upload utilities allow it as well, so no excuses.
  After it is done byteswapping and copying the original file, it will ask if you wish to extend the rom to the next typical size.  Typically, they doubled in size, though this isn't always the case and honestly it isn't especially important except in terms of stuffing the thing onto a cartridge or upload device.  Anyway, you have the option.  Select yes if you want to pad the file with zeroes.

  Source is included or should be.  So, instead of fussing over it requesting changes, you can just do it yourself and save the hassle.  Lovely.

  In terms of Animal Forest, if you drop a Doubutsu no Mori rom onto it, make sure you set it unbyteswapped and padded to 256Mb.
