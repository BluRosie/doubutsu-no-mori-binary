  This folder is dedicated to compressed binaries that were hacked.  If you need to change something falling within the compressed file, be sure to change it here.  I don't think that will really happen, but its better than nothing.
  The Images folder contains original targas for converted image text, when that shows up.

  An index of the binaries is in the Documentation folder one folder up from here, titled Index.txt suprisingly enough.  It should list these and many, many more.
